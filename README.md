# RGU-Game-Jam-2024
My game submission for the RGU Game Jam 2024.

The theme was to create a game based around Hydrogen, my submission: Hydrogenium, 
based in a post apocalypse where humans are all but exctint due to pollution  its up to
you to replace the old nuclear fuel cells with clean hydrogen and save the planet, along
the way you will encounter puzzles and platforming as well as a few suprises.

This GameJam only lasted 24 hours and I participated on my own creating the majority of
the sprites, bearing this in mind the project structure nd overall code are incredibly messy.
